## Test Data

### Kovan Testnet (PoC)

The following test was generated by interacting with PoC contracts (available at the `PoC/` directory) deployed on the Kovan testnet.

To check the results, uncomment the lines indicated in `src/agent.config.ts,` set a Kovan testnet RPC (e.g. `https://kovan.poa.network`) as `jsonRpcUrl` in your `forta.config.json` file and run:

```
npm run block 31914255
```

In the block `31914255`, `MockUmeeOracle,` PoC has a `reserveList` query with one `source` address. This `source` latest time was `Thu Jan 01, 1970` so bot emits finding for the staling price.
