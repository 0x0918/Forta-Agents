### Kovan Testnet (PoC)

The following test was generated by interacting with PoC contracts (available at the `PoC/` directory) deployed on the Kovan testnet.

To check the results, uncomment the lines indicated in `src/agent.config.ts,` set a Kovan testnet RPC (e.g. `https://kovan.poa.network`) as `jsonRpcUrl` in your `forta.config.json` file and run:
